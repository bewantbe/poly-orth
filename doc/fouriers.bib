For instance, a function that is constant inside the interval and zero elsewhere is called a rectangular window, which describes the shape of its graphical representation. When another function or waveform/data-sequence is multiplied by a window function, the product is also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap; the "view through the window". Applications of window functions include spectral analysis, filter design, and beamforming. In typical applications, the window functions used are non-negative smooth "bell-shaped" curves,[2] though rectangle, triangle, and other functions can be used.},

The new function is then known as the Fourier transform and/or the frequency spectrum of the function f. The Fourier transform is also a reversible operation. Thus, given the function one can determine the original function, f. (See Fourier inversion theorem.) f and are also respectively known as time domain and frequency domain representations of the same "event". Most often perhaps, f is a real-valued function, and is complex valued, where a complex number describes both the amplitude and phase of a corresponding frequency component. In general, f is also complex, such as the analytic representation of a real-valued function. The term "Fourier transform" refers to both the transform operation and to the complex-valued function it produces.},

	abstract = {The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used widely in signal processing for efficient computation of the FT of finite-length signals over a set of uniformly spaced frequency locations. However, in many applications, one requires nonuniform sampling in the frequency domain, i.e., a nonuniform FT. Several papers have described fast approximations for the nonuniform FT based on interpolating an oversampled FFT. This paper presents an interpolation method for the nonuniform FT that is optimal in the min-max sense of minimizing the worst-case approximation error over all signals of unit norm. The proposed method easily generalizes to multidimensional signals. Numerical results show that the min-max approach provides substantially lower approximation errors than conventional interpolation methods. The min-max criterion is also useful for optimizing the parameters of interpolation kernels such as the Kaiser-Bessel function.},

	abstract = {In mathematics and its applications, a classical Sturm–Liouville theory, named after Jacques Charles François Sturm (1803–1855) and Joseph Liouville (1809–1882), is the theory of a real second-order linear differential equation of the form

where y is a function of the free variable x. Here the functions p(x), q(x), and w(x) {\textgreater} 0 are specified at the outset. In the simplest of cases all coefficients are continuous on the finite closed interval [a,b], and p has continuous derivative. In this simplest of all cases, this function y is called a solution if it is continuously differentiable on (a,b) and satisfies the equation (1) at every point in (a,b). In addition, the unknown function y is typically required to satisfy some boundary conditions at a and b.  The function w(x), which is sometimes also called r(x), is called the "weight" or "density" function.
The value of λ is not specified in the equation; finding the values of λ for which there exists a non-trivial solution of (1) satisfying the boundary conditions is part of the Sturm–Liouville (S–L) problem.
Such values of λ, when they exist, are called the eigenvalues of the boundary value problem defined by (1) and the prescribed set of boundary conditions. The corresponding solutions (for each such λ) are the eigenfunctions of this problem. Under normal assumptions on the coefficient functions p(x), q(x), and w(x) above, they induce a Hermitian differential operator in some function space defined by boundary conditions. The resulting theory of the existence and asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues, the corresponding qualitative theory of the eigenfunctions and their completeness in a suitable function space became known as Sturm–Liouville theory. This theory is important in applied mathematics, where S–L problems  occur very commonly, particularly when dealing with linear partial differential equations that are separable.
A Sturm–Liouville (S–L) problem is said to be regular if p(x), w(x) {\textgreater} 0, and p(x), p′(x), q(x), and w(x) are continuous functions over the finite interval [a, b], and has separated boundary conditions of the form

Under the assumption that the S–L problem is regular, the main tenet of Sturm–Liouville theory states that:

The eigenvalues λ1, λ2, λ3, ... of the regular Sturm–Liouville problem (1)–(2)–(3) are real and can be ordered such that

  Corresponding to each eigenvalue λn is a unique (up to a normalization constant) eigenfunction yn(x) which has exactly n − 1 zeros in (a, b). The eigenfunction yn(x) is called the n-th fundamental solution satisfying the regular Sturm–Liouville problem (1)–(2)–(3).The normalized eigenfunctions form an orthonormal basis

	isbn = {978-0-521-41534-7},
	abstract = {In this treatise, the authors present the general theory of orthogonal polynomials on the complex plane and several of its applications. The assumptions on the measure of orthogonality are general, the only restriction is that it has compact support on the complex plane. In the development of the theory the main emphasis is on asymptotic behavior and the distribution of zeros. In the first two chapters exact upper and lower bounds are given for the orthonormal polynomials and for the location of their zeros. The next three chapters deal with regular n-th root asymptotic behavior, which plays a key role both in the theory and in its applications. Orthogonal polynomials with this behavior correspond to classical orthogonal polynomials in the general case, and many extremal properties of measures in mathematical analysis and approximation theory with this type of regularity turn out to be equivalent. Several easy-to-use criteria are presented for regular behavior. The last chapter contains applications of the theory, including exact rates for convergence of rational interpolants, best rational approximants and non-diagonal Pade approximants to Markov functions (Cauchy transforms of measures). The results are based on potential theoretic methods, so both the methods and the results can be extended to extremal polynomials in norms other than L2 norms. A sketch of the theory of logarithmic potentials is given in an appendix.},
